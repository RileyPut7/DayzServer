Paragon Storage Setup

once you have the mod loaded and working on your server theres a few settings to change
first is to setup the attach to for the codelocks 
go to your servers ServerProfile>CodeLock>CodeLockConfig.json
and set CanRaidTents "true"
now thats thats setup you need to add the different storages to the hacking .json it will be in the Paragon_Storage folder
then you change how long you want the raid time to be and how many batteries each safe takes
